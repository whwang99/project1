    on paper
    by Jacqueline Woodson
    
    The first time I write my full name
    
    Jacqueline Amanda Woodson
    
    without anybody's help
    on a clean white page in my composition notebook,
    I know
    
    if I wanted to
    
    I could write anything.
    
    Letters becoming words, words gathering meaning,
    becoming
    thoughts outside my head
    
    becoming sentences
    
    written by
    
    Jacqueline Amanda Woodson
